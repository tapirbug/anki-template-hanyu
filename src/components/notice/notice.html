      Special thanks go out to Stefanie Yu for making the vocabulary in
      "Chinesisch lernen fÃ¼r die Sinolopgie, Band 1" available on Quizlet and
      to the authors of the book, Xia Baige and Wolfgang Zeidl.<br>

      Stefanie Yu kindly gave permission to make an Anki version of her
      vocabulary on Quizlet that can be freely shared among students of
      the University of Vienna.<br>
      
      Note that the Github version does _not_ include this vocabulary. If you
      are a student of the University of Vienna, you can get it from the Moodle
      course.
