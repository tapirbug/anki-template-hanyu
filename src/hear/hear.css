/* This file will hides the android player on desktop, and makes sure

   In the version of the desktop of version of Anki I tried, the player expands
   to something like:
   <a class="replay-button soundLink" href="#" onclick="pycmd('play:q:0'); return false;">
   in the final HTML observed by a JS snippet.

   That exact code might change of course, but it seems likely that whatever it
   changes to will also involve some kind of child tag that is not just text.
   Anki Droid on the other hand does not change it into anything else, and we
   are hoping that this also does not change.

   We exploit these assumptions to stop the mobile anki from showing the
   solution from the desktop {{tts}} tag that it cannot properly handle and
   where it instead just shows the text. */

/* Show nothing per default (because Anki Droid would show the text for desktop
   AND mobile, both of which is unwanted). On desktop the tts tag would be
   shown as text, which we also do not want. */

/* But on desktop we want to see the play button, which does not conttain

   font-size to a reasonable guess. */
